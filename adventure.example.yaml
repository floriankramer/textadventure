adventure:
  name: "The unfortunate loss of a mushroom"
  start: dungeon
  intro: |
    You wake up in a dark and dingy dungeon cell. Water drips from the ceiling,
    and the walls are moist. The iron bars in front of the window seem rusted,
    but are still holding up. The door is made from very solid looking old oak.
    A pile of straw lies in the corner, although who ever tossed you into here
    did not do you the curtesy of dropping you on the straw.

    dungeon:
      description:
        Your cell is a dark, musty wet and cold room. Bare stone walls, rusty
        bars in front of the window and a very solid looking door dominate it.
        There is a pile of straw in the corner.
      actions:
        - name: Search the Straw
          yields:

          text: |
            You dig through the damp straw. After a while of searching, you
            find an old bone, roughly filed into the shape of a key. You wonder
            how it came to be here, but decide that some questions should
            rather be left unanswered.
          depends:
            not:

        - name: Scream for help
          text: |
            You cry out with all your might. The deep desperation of the lost
            echoes in you voice, and you feel like a hundred fallen souls
            join in with your cry. When your breath runs out, nothing
            remains but deafening silence, and the certainty that shouting
            will not avail you here.
        - name: Try the key in the door
          text: |
            Still puzzling about why there is a key in your cell you decide to
            try your luck with the door. To your surprise, the key fits into the
            old lock, and when you turn it the bolt slides back. When you take
            out the key again you wonder if it didn't only have two teeth
            earlier. But that is of little importance now, as you step into
            the corridor.

            on:

    corridor:
      description: |
        A dark corridor full of locked doors leading to cells, and a twisting
        stair leading upwards. The door to your cell stands slightly ajar.
        You have the odd feeling that you are being watched from the empty\
        cells, but there is nothing in them but bits of straw, and puddles
        of water on the floor.
      actions:
        - name: Walk up the stairs
          text: |
            As soon as you reach the bottom of the stairs you can hear rough
            voices coming down from above. It appears that there are two men
            at the top of the stairs, playing a game of dice. Deciding that
            you will not give in to chance, you step back.

          text: |
            You decide to give up. Nothing happens. After having given up for a
            while you then decide that it was a silly idea, and keep on going.
            You make a mental note of considering the philosophy of this later
            on.
